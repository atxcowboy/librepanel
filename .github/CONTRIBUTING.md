# Contribution

Before you start working on a PR, contact us via [Discord](https://discord.librepanel.org) or the forum at [https://forum.librepanel.org](https://forum.librepanel.org) to get a clue whether someone else isn't already working on it or if we don not want/need this certain change. Of course, bugfixes are always welcome.

Please always focus on the **main** branch of our [Github repository](https://github.com/LibrePanel/LibrePanel).

## Checklist

General rules for PRs are:

* Please save us all some trouble and unnecessary round-trips by _testing_ your changes.
* Re-write your commit history to provide a CLEAN history!
    * i.e. do not provide PRs which contain a commit that changes something, the next changes it back, a third one changes it again, only a little differently...

Thanks!
